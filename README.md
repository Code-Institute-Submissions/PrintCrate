# PrintCrate

A full ecommerce website built in Django for purchasing of 3D-printed models.  

The target market is primarily customers that require designed pieces to fulfil niche requirements, products that may not be available as lone pieces elsewhere (e.g. spare parts) or customisation of existing model dimensions to suit their purpose (e.g. clean attachment to desks of various thicknesses without screw-fixtures).  

The webshop boasts a modern and intuitive shopping experience, providing customers with options to purchase from standard stock items or request commissions.
